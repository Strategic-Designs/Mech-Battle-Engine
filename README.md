# Project Description

**Project Name:** Mech Battle Engine

**Mech Battle Engine** is a clean-room, from-scratch reimplementation of the *Total Annihilation* (TA) game engine, designed to operate as a modern, 64-bit executable fully compatible with the original game’s data formats. This project enables continued play and preservation of *Total Annihilation* on modern systems, without relying on or distributing any original Cavedog or GT Interactive code or assets.

## Project Scope and Functionality

This project:

- Recreates the core engine behavior of *Total Annihilation*, including unit simulation, resource management, AI, scripting, and multiplayer gameplay.
- Implements an original, modern 64-bit engine architecture using clean-room methods.
- Loads game content from the user’s legally owned *Total Annihilation* installation, including units, maps, audio, and graphical assets.
- Aims to provide behavioral compatibility with the original game.

## What This Project Does Not Do

- Does not contain, reference, or redistribute any copyrighted material from the original *Total Annihilation*.
- Does not decompile, copy, or reuse any portion of the original game’s binary code.
- Is not a modification or wrapper of the original 32-bit executable.
- Does not include any original art, sound, or map files.
- Is not intended for commercial use; it is released solely for educational and preservation purposes, under a license that prohibits unauthorized redistribution or monetization.

## Legal and Usage Requirements

- Users must supply their own legally obtained copy of *Total Annihilation* to use this engine.
- The engine functions as a compatibility layer for loading and executing original content formats.
- Developers contributing to this project may analyze the original game’s behavior and disassembled code to understand its functionality; however, they must not copy or transcribe any code, algorithms, or logic verbatim. All implemented game logic must be independently re-created based on documented behavior, testing, and clean-room reconstruction methods.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of Mech Battle Engine is to preserve and modernize the *Total Annihilation* gameplay experience by rebuilding a compatible engine using modern development standards. This enables the community to maintain, extend, and run the game on modern 64-bit platforms while respecting the rights of the original intellectual property holders.
