# Project Description

**Project Name:** Mech Battle Engine

This project is a clean-room reimplementation of the Total Annihilation (TA) game engine, rebuilt from scratch as a modern 64-bit engine designed to run the original TA game data files.

## What This Project Does

- Implements all core gameplay systems (unit movement, combat, AI, resource management) with completely original source code written through clean room methods.  
- Supports multiplayer gameplay behaviorally compatible with the original game.  
- Loads and uses the original TA game data files (units, maps, sounds, etc.), which **must be supplied by the user** from their legally owned copy of the game. This project does **not** include or distribute any original game assets.

## What This Project Is Not

- This is **not** a modification or redistribution of the original Total Annihilation executable or assets.  
- This project does **not** include or provide the original game data files.  
- This is **not** a commercial product; commercial use is prohibited without explicit permission.  
- This is **not** a direct copy or decompilation of the original gameâ€™s source code.

## Why It Matters

The original TA engine is 32-bit and limited on modern systems. This rewrite lets the community preserve and play the game on modern platforms with improved performance and maintainability, all while respecting original intellectual property by only using user-supplied game data.
